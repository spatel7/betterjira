Chrome extension that updates JIRA so that external links and issue links open in new tabs

### Step 1: Configure extension for your company
1. Clone this repository
2. Open up `manifest.json`
3. Search for `https://jira.COMPANY_DOMAIN.com`, and replace `COMPANY_DOMAIN` to match the url you see when you open JIRA in your browser

### Step 2: Load extension into Chrome
1. Open Chrome and go to your extensions by typing `chrome://extensions` into the URL
2. Enable developer mode (toggle in the top right corner of the page)
3. Select `Load unpacked` and load this repository from your files

### Step 3: Have fun
When this extension is enabled, any links on JIRA web pages that link to issues should open up in new tabs.
